# Mastermind
The objective of this program is to be able to break codes.
The program will try to solve any code with n positions and m colors. It does this by generating every combination of codes with these parameters. The program is also given two clues to work with, the number of correct positions and the number of incorrect positions but correct color, allowing it to eliminate codes in the sample space that are inconsistent with these clues given. It will continue requesting clues until it is able to eliminate the sample space down to one code. 

Knowledge used in this program includes recursion, combinatorics, and basic data structures decision-making for efficient time-complexity. 

This program has one class, MasterMind.java.
